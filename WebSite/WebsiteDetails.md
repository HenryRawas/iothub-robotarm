# Website details #

Once you have your website running, you'll notice more is being displayed on the charts than just the raw data.  Here you'll learn about the features of the website that weren't discussed during setup.

#### Data graphs ####
There is a graph for each of the measurements - temperature, load, position, voltage. Each graph shows one line for each joint in the device. As data arrives, the graphs are updated.

#### Dots on the graph ####
You'll see dots showing up on the graph if there are any alerts for that data.  Hovering over that dot shows you the value during the alert, and what that alert is.

#### Commands ####
Below the charts you will see a list of clickable commands that can be sent to the device. These can be used to resume after an alert, or to ask the device to perform a particular sequence.

#### Alert table ####
Below the commands, you'll see a table listing all the alerts coming from the device or from the Anomaly detection service. Each entry includes the message, time, and what alert was fired.
